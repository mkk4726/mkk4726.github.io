# 작문 해보기

What did I learn today?
I learned expression about how to ask past experiences.

I can ask to my friend, "Hi bro, have you been to Gangnam?".
Also I can ask "Did you try any taco?"

One of the reason I practice speaking english is that I want to have casual conversation with foreign friends.
So, this expresions are helpful. 

## 피드백 및 수정

### 주요 수정 사항:
1. **문법 오류**: "expression" → "expressions" (복수형)
2. **전치사**: "ask to my friend" → "ask my friend" (to 불필요)
3. **문법**: "One of the reason" → "One of the reasons" (복수형)
4. **철자**: "english" → "English" (대문자)
5. **문법**: "this expresions" → "these expressions" (복수형 + 철자)

### 수정된 버전:

**What did I learn today?**
I learned expressions about how to ask about past experiences.

I can ask my friend, "Hi bro, have you been to Gangnam?"
I can also ask, "Have you tried any tacos?"

One of the reasons I practice speaking English is that I want to have casual conversations with foreign friends.
So, these expressions are helpful.

### 추가 개선 제안:
- "Hi bro"는 매우 친근한 표현이므로 상황에 맞게 사용
- "Have you tried"가 "Did you try"보다 더 자연스러움
- "tacos"는 보통 복수형으로 사용
- "conversations"도 복수형이 더 자연스러움
