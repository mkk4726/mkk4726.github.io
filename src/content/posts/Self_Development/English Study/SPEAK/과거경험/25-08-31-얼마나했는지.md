How long have you been studying English?

I've been studying English for ten years.

I've been studying English since ~

> 얼마나 오랫동안 해왔는지 물어보거나 답할 때 사용할 수 있는 표현들


# Simple writing

Today I learned expressions that can used when I ask or answer the how long I did.
These are very useful.

Maybe I have little concert 연말에. So some can ask me, "How long have you been playing the guitar"
I can answer that "I've been playing the guitar for 1 year".

## Corrected version:

Today I learned expressions that can be used when I ask or answer how long I have been doing something.
These are very useful.

Maybe I have a little concert at the end of the year. So someone can ask me, "How long have you been playing the guitar?"
I can answer that "I've been playing the guitar for 1 year".

# Feedback & rewrting version

## Grammar corrections made:

1. **"can used"** → **"can be used"** (missing verb "be")
2. **"the how long I did"** → **"how long I have been doing something"** (correct tense and structure)
3. **"little concert"** → **"a little concert"** (missing article)
4. **"연말에"** → **"at the end of the year"** (translated to English)
5. **"some can ask me"** → **"someone can ask me"** (correct pronoun)
6. **Added question mark** after the question

## Key learning points:

- Use **Present Perfect Continuous** (have/has been + -ing) for ongoing actions
- **"How long have you been + -ing?"** is the correct question format
- **"for + time period"** shows duration (e.g., "for 1 year")
- **"since + specific time"** shows starting point (e.g., "since 2020")
