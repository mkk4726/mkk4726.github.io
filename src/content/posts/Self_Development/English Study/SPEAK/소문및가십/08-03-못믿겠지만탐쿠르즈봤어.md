# 간단한 작문

Believe it or not, I will have love metting(?소개팅, 영어로 뭐지).
Someone who is joined in same project suggest it to me.
I like her style, maybe she has lovely smile I guess in the picture.

You may not know this, my 이상형 is someone who has lovely smile and isn't short (more than 165cm).

# 피드백이랑 더 자연스러운 작문

Believe it or not, I'm going on a blind date this weekend!
Someone from the same project suggested it to me.
I really like her style, and from her picture, I can see she has a lovely smile.

You might not know this about me, but my ideal type is someone with a beautiful smile and who isn't too short (preferably over 165cm).

I'm actually quite nervous about it. I haven't been on a blind date in ages, and I'm not sure what to expect. But I'm trying to stay positive and just be myself.

The person who set us up said we have similar interests and personalities, so hopefully we'll hit it off. I'm planning to meet her at a nice café downtown - nothing too fancy, just somewhere comfortable where we can talk and get to know each other.

Wish me luck! I'll let you know how it goes.

# 피드백

## 원본 작문의 문제점들:

1. **문법 오류들:**
   - "I will have love metting" → "I'm going on a blind date"
   - "Someone who is joined" → "Someone who joined" 
   - "suggest it to me" → "suggested it to me"

2. **어휘 선택:**
   - "love meeting" → "blind date" (소개팅의 정확한 표현)
   - "이상형" → "ideal type" 또는 "type"

3. **자연스러운 표현:**
   - "I guess in the picture" → "from her picture, I can see"
   - "isn't short" → "isn't too short"

## 개선된 점들:

1. **더 자연스러운 문장 구조**
2. **감정과 상황 설명 추가** (긴장감, 계획 등)
3. **대화체 톤 유지** (친근하고 자연스러운 느낌)
4. **구체적인 세부사항** (카페에서 만나기, 비슷한 관심사 등)

## 학습 포인트:
- 소개팅 = blind date
- "hit it off" = 잘 맞다, 사이가 좋다
- "in ages" = 오랫동안
- "set us up" = 소개해주다
