**B:** I'd love to, but I'm saving for retirement, so I can't afford it right now.
**A:** Oh, I understand. How about we try that bed and breakfast place instead? It's much cheaper.
**B:** Actually, I've been saving, so I can afford it. Let's go to the original restaurant!

## 상황 2: 가족과 여행 계획할 때
**Mom:** Kids, we're thinking about a family trip to Europe this summer. What do you think?
**Son:** Mom, I can afford it! I've been working part-time and saving money.
**Daughter:** I'm saving for college, so I can't afford it. But maybe we could find a cheaper alternative?
**Dad:** That's very responsible of you both. Let's look for some budget-friendly options.

## 상황 3: 동료와 점심 식사할 때

**You:** I can afford it, but I'm trying to be more careful with my spending lately.
**Colleague:** Fair enough. How about the food court instead?
**You:** Perfect! I've been saving, so I can afford that easily.

## 상황 4: 룸메이트와 생활비 논의할 때
**Roommate:** The rent is going up next month. Can you handle the increase?
**You:** I'm saving for a down payment on a house, so I can't afford it if it's too much.
**Roommate:** I understand. I've been saving too, so I can afford a bit more. Let's split it fairly.
**You:** Thanks! That really helps me out.
