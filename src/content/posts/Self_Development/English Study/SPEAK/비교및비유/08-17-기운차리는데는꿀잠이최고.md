# 배운 표현들 

There is nothing as motivating as a deadline.
There is nothing as motivating as a good salary.
There is nothing as demotivating as a rejection letter.
There is noting as encouring as a supportive family.
There is noting as refresing as a goodnight's sleep.


He is not only my husband but also my bestfriend.
He is not only intelligence but also atheletic.


# 간단한 작문

Today I learned expressions using "nothing as ~ as " and "not only ~ but only".
These are used to explain something.

When I express what it is amazing, I can say like that there is nothing as motivating as mindfulness.
It is so helpful to me, it makes me more calm and focused.
It is not only helpful for healthy mind but also helpful for succesful life.
I can make more success when I can focused. Mindfulness make me more focused to kill monkey-mind.
And if my mind be more peaceful, I can be more focused.

In my opinion, focusness (몰입) is component of happy. We can be happy when we feel focusness.
So mindfulness make us more happy.

# 피드백 및 수정된 버전

## 피드백
전반적으로 mindfulness와 focus에 대한 좋은 생각들을 표현했습니다! 문법과 어휘 선택 부분에서 몇 가지 개선점이 있습니다:

**주요 개선 포인트:**
1. **동사 시제 일치**: "makes", "is", "helps" 등 현재형 동사의 일관성
2. **관사 사용**: "a" 또는 "the" 적절한 사용
3. **어휘 선택**: 더 자연스러운 영어 표현들
4. **문장 구조**: 좀 더 매끄러운 연결
