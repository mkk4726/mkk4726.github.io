## 피드백 (Feedback)

Your writing shows a good understanding of the "so ~ that" and "such" structures! Here are some suggestions for improvement:

**Grammar corrections:**
- "representations(표현)" → "expressions" (더 자연스러운 표현)
- "If someone ask me" → "If someone **asks** me" (3인칭 단수)
- "I wll answer" → "I **will** answer" (오타)
- "Or do you want to eat lunch" → "Or **if you ask** do you want to eat lunch" (문맥상 더 자연스러움)
- "let's summary" → "let's **summarize**" (동사형)
- "metapor somthing" → "**metaphor** something" (철자)

**Structure improvements:**
- 문장들을 더 자연스럽게 연결할 수 있어요
- 예시를 더 다양하게 들 수 있어요

### Understanding "So ~ That" and "Such" Expressions

Today I learned about powerful expressions using "so ~ that" and "such" that help us emphasize situations or describe people more vividly.

#### How these expressions work:

**"So ~ that" structure:**
- Used with adjectives/adverbs
- Pattern: so + adjective/adverb + that + result/consequence
- Example: "I'm so hungry that I could eat a horse."

**"Such" structure:**
- Used with nouns (often with adjectives)
- Pattern: such + (adjective) + noun
- Example: "He's such a poser" or "She's such a drama queen."

#### Personal examples:

When someone asks about my personality, I can confidently say "I'm such a dog person" because I absolutely love dogs and prefer their company to cats. This expression immediately conveys my strong preference.

If someone invites me to lunch when I'm starving, I might respond, "Yes! I'm so hungry that I could eat a horse!" This dramatically emphasizes just how hungry I am.

#### Why these expressions are useful:

These metaphorical expressions add color and emphasis to our speech. Instead of simply saying "I'm hungry," saying "I'm so hungry that I could eat a horse" creates a vivid image and shows the intensity of the feeling. Similarly, calling someone "such a drama queen" is much more expressive than just saying "she's dramatic."

#### Additional examples for practice:

- "The movie was so boring that I fell asleep."
- "He's such a night owl that he never goes to bed before 2 AM."
- "The weather is so nice that we should go for a walk."
- "She's such a know-it-all that nobody wants to work with her."

These expressions help make our English more natural and emotionally expressive, allowing us to communicate not just facts but also our feelings and attitudes.
