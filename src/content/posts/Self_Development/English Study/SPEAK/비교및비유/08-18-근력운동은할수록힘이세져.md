하면 할수록 좋아


As you speak more, you get more confident.

The more you speak, the more confident you get.

The more you lift, the stronger you get.

# 배운 것들 정리

The more you run, the fitter you get.

Lift is like a box of chocalates.

# 간단한 작문

Today I learned expressions using "the more ~, the more" and "~ is like ~".
These expression is used to metaphor ~~.

I had band 합주 class today. It was so much fun.
합이 맞는다는 느낌은 굉장히 기분이 좋더라. 
I learend guiatr a year from last year.
I'm sure that the more I practice, the better I play.
(조금씩 기타를 잘 치게 되는 걸 느낄 때 굉장히 기쁘다.)
When I feel I'm playing guitar little better than before, I feel so happy.

Practing guitar is like a life.
No matter what I do, I can be better if I practice consistently.
Don't be hurry up, just take  the rythm. 

# 더 자연스러운 버전

Today I learned expressions using "the more ~, the more" and "~ is like ~".
**These expressions are used for metaphors.**

I had a band practice class today. It was so much fun.
**The feeling of being in sync was amazing.**
I **have been learning** guitar **for** a year **since last year**.
I'm sure that the more I practice, the better I **will** play.
**When I feel myself getting a little better at guitar than before, I feel so happy.**

**Playing** guitar is like **life itself**.
No matter what I do, I can **get** better if I practice consistently.
**Don't rush, just keep** the **rhythm**.

# 피드백

## 👍 잘한 점들:
- "the more ~, the more" 구조를 정확하게 사용했습니다
- 전체적인 메시지가 명확하게 전달됩니다
- 은유(metaphor) 표현을 잘 활용했습니다

## 🔧 문법 수정사항:
1. **"These expression"** → "These expressions" (복수형)
2. **"metaphor"** → "metaphors" (동사 뒤에는 명사 복수형)
3. **"I learend"** → "I have been learning" (현재완료진행형이 더 자연스럽)
4. **"a year from last year"** → "for a year since last year" (기간 표현)
5. **"Practing"** → "Playing" (철자 + 더 자연스러운 표현)
6. **"be hurry up"** → "rush" (더 간단하고 자연스러운 표현)
7. **"rythm"** → "rhythm" (철자)

## 💡 표현 개선:
- "합이 맞는다" → "being in sync"가 더 자연스럽습니다
- "life" → "life itself"로 강조
- 괄호 안의 한국어를 영어로 자연스럽게 번역했습니다

전반적으로 좋은 작문이었습니다! 계속 연습하시면 더욱 자연스러워질 거예요! 🎸
