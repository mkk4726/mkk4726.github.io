# 배운 것들

- One one hand
- One the other hand

On one hand the note has really big screen.
On the other the iPhone has a really good camera.

On one hand, I haven`t had chinees food in a while.
On the other hand, I'm craving fried chicken.

Whether we eat Chinese food or fried chicken, we should order dilivery.

The best thing about iPhone is its design.

When it comes to online shopping, Amazon might be the best option.

Although it`s a bit pricey, the bar has amazing view at night.

Even though i`m not a big fan of animated films, I love Frozen.

The dress is too expensive. It's pretty though.

It's not about design. It's about performance.

In which case, I'll probably go with the new Galaxy.
