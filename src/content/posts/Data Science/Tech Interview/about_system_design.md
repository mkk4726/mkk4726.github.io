87% of AI engineers fail system design interviews.
The gap isn't code, it's thinking at scale.
This will help you 👇 

Most crack under these bottlenecks: 
🔸 Feature thinking vs. failure planning
🔸 Zero production battle scars 
🔸 Can't architect for 10M users

These 4 resources fix your foundation:
1. System Design Primer 
→ https://lnkd.in/gmAg4nBb 
→ Master the patterns that matter

2. Complete System Design
→ https://lnkd.in/gTJmDMYD 
→ Real architectures, not toy examples

3. Stanford MLSys Seminars 
→ https://lnkd.in/gP3UDqwn 
→ How Netflix/Uber actually scale

4. AI Engineering (Chip Huyen) 
→ https://lnkd.in/gp-WeZte 
→ Modern systems for AI workloads

The difference? 
Most engineers optimize for features. 
System architects optimize for failures.
And very much applies to AI Agents as well!

Start with #1. 
Build battle-tested thinking.
What's your biggest system design blind spot?
