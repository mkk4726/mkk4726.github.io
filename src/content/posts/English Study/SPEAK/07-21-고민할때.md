On one hand, the Note has a really big screen.

On one hand, I haven`t had Korean food in a while

On one hand, taking a cab would be really convenient

On the other hand, the new iPhone has a really good camera.

On the other hand, I`m craving fried chicken.

On the other hand, I can walk there in 15 minute.

Whether I buy the Note or the new iPhone, I should buy a phone tommorow.
