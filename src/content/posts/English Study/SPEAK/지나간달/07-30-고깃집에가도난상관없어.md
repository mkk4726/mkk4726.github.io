## 피드백

### 문법 오류
- "pioneers" → "peers" (동료를 의미할 때)
- "phares" → "phrases" (철자 오류)
- "that is" → "that are" (phrases는 복수)
- "wonder my codes" → "wonder about my code" (code는 보통 단수형 사용)
- "almost foods" → "almost all foods" (거의 모든 음식)
- "chinese foods" → "Chinese food" (음식은 보통 단수형)

### 표현 개선
- "I totally agree about" → "I totally agree with"
- "I'm willing to share" → 더 자연스러운 표현으로 개선
- "Let me know if you wonder" → 더 자연스러운 표현으로 개선
