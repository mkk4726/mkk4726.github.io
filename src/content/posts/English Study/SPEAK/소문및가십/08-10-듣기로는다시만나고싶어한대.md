## 피드백 및 수정사항

### 문법적 오류 수정:
1. **"heared"** → **"heard"** (hear의 과거형)
2. **"matchmaker"** → **"the matchmaker"** (관사 필요)
3. **"she know"** → **"she knows"** (3인칭 단수 현재형)
4. **"my blind date has really good personality"** → **"my blind date has a really good personality"** (관사 필요)
5. **"After date"** → **"After the date"** (관사 필요)
6. **"I have a good emotion to her"** → **"I have good feelings toward her"** (더 자연스러운 표현)
7. **"I wanna know"** → **"I want to know"** (공식적인 작문에서는 완전한 형태 사용)

### 더 자연스러운 표현:
- **"According to what she knows"** - "from what she know"보다 더 자연스러움
- **"good feelings toward her"** - "good emotion to her"보다 더 자연스러운 표현
- **"harmless"** - "무해하다"의 적절한 영어 번역
