I read a book called "Atomic Habits" that tells me how to build habits.

The book says to try to break things down into smaller pieces.
This makes me do more because it reduces the psychological burden.

So the lesson in the book is to make sure to make things clear, attractive, and easy.


# 영어 작문 연습 (한글 내용 기반)

I think habits are the most important thing in life. According to research by Professor Wendy Wood at Duke University, about 45% of our behavior comes from habits.

The book "Atomic Habits" suggests the 2-minute rule. Try to break down what you need to do into very small tasks that can be finished in 2 minutes.

I applied this to my life for about 1-2 months and it was really effective. The biggest reason is that it reduces psychological burden. Usually, we procrastinate because of psychological pressure.

When I break down tasks into small 2-minute pieces, this burden almost disappears. By achieving small things, I can gradually do more things with that sense of accomplishment.

For breaking bad habits, you should make them difficult to do. Human willpower has limits, so environment is the most important thing.

I had a bad habit of looking at my phone late at night and sleeping late. To solve this, I bought an alarm clock. Now I don't bring my phone to bed and turn it off as soon as I get home.

The key lessons are:
- Try to break tasks into very small pieces to reduce psychological burden
- Make sure to create an environment where you can't do bad habits
- Remember that willpower is limited, so focus on changing your environment
