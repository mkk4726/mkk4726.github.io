You did a great job on the solving problem.
Working on company 1년 조금넘게, I solved a lot of problems.
On the OCR project, I solve communicate problem and make greak OCR pipeline.
On the chatbot project, I made chatbot which 만족하다 고객사`s needs.

And then, I'm happy to see that you`ve overcome of 비교하면서 뒤쳐진다고 느끼는 fear.

## 수정된 버전:

Today I want to compliment myself.

You did a great job at problem-solving.
Working at a company for a little over a year, I have solved many problems.
On the OCR project, I solved communication issues and built a great OCR pipeline.
On the chatbot project, I created a chatbot that satisfied the client's needs.

I'm happy to see that you've overcome the fear of comparing yourself to others and feeling behind.
When I was 21-25, I was frozen because of the fear that I was falling behind and my life was ruined.

I can tell that your life is great. You're living a fulfilling life. And a normal life is always wonderful.

## 피드백:

**잘한 점:**
- 배운 표현들 (You did a great job on, I'm happy to see that, I can tell that)을 실제 상황에 적용하려고 노력했어요
- 자신의 경험을 바탕으로 진정성 있는 내용을 썼어요
- 자기 격려라는 주제를 잘 선택했어요

**개선점:**
1. **단어 선택**: "complement" → "compliment" (칭찬하다)
2. **문법**: "on the solving problem" → "at problem-solving" 
3. **시제 일관성**: 과거와 현재완료 시제를 상황에 맞게 사용
4. **한영 혼용**: 한국어 부분을 영어로 완전히 번역하여 자연스럽게 표현
5. **전치사**: "overcome of" → "overcome" (overcome은 전치사 없이 사용)

**다음에 시도해볼 것:**
- 한 문장 안에서는 한 언어로 통일하기
- 문장을 쓰기 전에 전체 구조를 영어로 먼저 생각해보기
- 배운 표현을 더 다양한 상황에 적용해보기
